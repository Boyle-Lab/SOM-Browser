<p class="content_main">Several types of annotations are available in the browser, describing different aspects of selective pressure and functional associations pertinent to each grammatical pattern and CRM:</p>
<p class="content_main">
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Selection and Functional Constraint<ol type="a">
            <p><li>PhastCons Coverage/Average/Max/Min</p>
	    <p><a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/15/8/1034.full" target="blank_">PhastCons</a> conserved elements and scores are used as a measure of sequence-level evolutionary constraint. PhastCons elements are contguous stretches of nucleotides predicted to be conserved between species in a multiple alignment, while PhastCons scores represent the estimated probability that an individual nucleotide is conserved across species. PhastCons Coverage represents the fraction of nucleotides within a CRM that lie within PhastCons elements, ranging from 0 to 1. PhastCons Average represents the average PhastCons score across all nucleotides in a CRM, while PhastCons Max and Min represent the highest and lowest PhastCons scores observed in a CRM.</p>
	    </li>
       	    <p><li>PhyloP Average/Max/Min</p>
	    <p><a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2009/10/26/gr.097857.109.full.pdf+html" target="blank_">PhyloP</a> scores indicate non-neutral substitution rates on individual nucleotides in a multiple sequence alignment. PhyloP scores are more flexible than PhastCons scores, and can indicate both lower rates of nucleotide substitution (conservation) or accelerated rates of nucleotide substitution (positive selection). Specifically, scores above zero indicate slower-than-neutral substitution rates (conservation) while negative scores indicate faster-than-neutral substitution rates (accelerated evolution/positive selection). The PhyloP Average measure, like the PhastCons average measure, summarizes the average constraint across entire CRMs. The PhyloP Max indicates the strongest conservation score at a single nucleotide within a CRM (assuming a maximum score > 0), while the PhyloP Min expresses the strongest signature for accelerated substitution at a single position within a CRM (assuming a minimum score < 0).</p>
	    </li>
       	    <p><li>Selected Sites</p>
	    <p>Selected Sites gives an estimate of the fraction of individual nucleotide sites within a CRM that are under selection, i.e., evolving at a rate significantly different than that expected under a neutral substitution model. This fraction was calculated based on the method adapted from <a href="http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/68/245.extract" target="blank_">Chiaromonte et al., 2003.</a>Briefly, the empirical cumulative distribution functions were computed for PhyloP scores within CRMs and ancestral repeat sequences, which are presumed to be neutrally evolving. The fraction of sites under selection was computed according to equation 1:</p>
	    <p><img src="[% c.uri_for('/static/images/selsites.png') %]" name="Selected sites formula"/></p>
	    <p>Where F<sub>sel</sub> and F<sub>neut</sub> are the Gaussian kernel density estimates for selection in CRMs and ancestral repeats, respectively. Elements were separated by chromosome and divided into three equally-sized GC-content bins to reduce biases arrising from regional variations in substitution rates\
 and base composition.</p>

        </ol></li>
	<li>Gene Expression<ol type="a">
            <li>
	    <p>Gene expression data are based on RNA-seq datasets from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="blank_">ENCODE DCC Portal</a> for human K562 and GM12878, and mouse MEL and CH12 cells. Data were obtained as fastq sequencing reads and bam alignments and expression levels were estimated using two methods. First, <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/" target="blank_">kallisto</a> and <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/" target="blank_">sleuth</a> were used to map and quantify RNA-seq reads directly from the fastq reads. We prepared an alternative version of these data to which we applied a simple quantile normalization to mitigate the impact of sequencing batch effects. Second, we used an alternative method incorporating explicit normalization for batch effects,0 based on methods used <a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/4-121/v1" target="blank_">here.</a> All expression values are expressed as transcripts per million (TPM).</p>
	    </li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>Gene Ontology<ol type="a">
	    <li>
	    <p>Gene Ontology terms provide a uniform framework for classifying genes according to three functional aspects: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. Molecular function describes the molecular activities. Cellular component describes where in cells the gene product is active. Biological process describes pathways and broad processes in which a gene is active. More information is available <a href="http://geneontology.org/page/ontology-documentation" target="blank_">here.</a></p>
	    <p>In our dataset, CRMs within each grammatical pattern have been assigned to target genes based on the nearest TSS, and these sets of genes were used to mine the GO database for enriched terms using the <a href="http://chip-enrich.med.umich.edu/" target="blank_">ChipEnrich</a> R package. The resulting lists were further collapsed using the <a href="http://revigo.irb.hr/" target="blank_">REVIGO</a> tool and results are presented as dot plots and in tabular form.</p>

	<li>Histone Modifications<ol type="a">
	    <li>
	    <p>Histone modifications are used by cells to specify different functional states in chromatin, and can be a valuable predictive tool in ascribing potential functions to stretches of DNA. Histone modification ChIP-seq data were obtained from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="blank_">ENCODE DCC Portal</a> for human K562 and GM12878, and mouse MEL and CH12 cells. CRMs were annotated with the maximum position-wise score observed within each element for seven histone modifications.</p>
