<p class="content_main">Several types of annotations are available in the browser, describing different aspects of selective pressure and functional associations pertinent to each grammatical pattern and CRM:</p>
<p class="content_main">
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Selection and Functional Constraint<ol type="a">
            <p><li>PhastCons Coverage/Average/Max/Min</p>
	    <p><a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/15/8/1034.full" target="blank_">PhastCons</a> conserved elements and scores are used as a measure of sequence-level evolutionary constraint. PhastCons elements are contguous stretches of nucleotides predicted to be conserved between species in a multiple alignment, while PhastCons scores represent the estimated probability that an individual nucleotide is conserved across species. PhastCons Coverage represents the fraction of nucleotides within a CRM that lie within PhastCons elements, ranging from 0 to 1. PhastCons Average represents the average PhastCons score across all nucleotides in a CRM, while PhastCons Max and Min represent the highest and lowest PhastCons scores observed in a CRM.</p>
	    </li>
       	    <p><li>PhyloP Average/Max/Min</p>
	    <p><a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2009/10/26/gr.097857.109.full.pdf+html" target="blank_">PhyloP</a> scores indicate non-neutral substitution rates on individual nucleotides in a multiple sequence alignment. PhyloP scores are more flexible than PhastCons scores, and can indicate both lower rates of nucleotide substitution (conservation) or accelerated rates of nucleotide substitution (positive selection). Specifically, scores above zero indicate slower-than-neutral substitution rates (conservation) while negative scores indicate faster-than-neutral substitution rates (accelerated evolution/positive selection). The PhyloP Average measure, like the PhastCons average measure, summarizes the average constraint across entire CRMs. The PhyloP Max indicates the strongest conservation score at a single nucleotide within a CRM (assuming a maximum score > 0), while the PhyloP Min expresses the strongest signature for accelerated substitution at a single position within a CRM (assuming a minimum score < 0).</p>
	    </li>
       	    <p><li>Selected Sites</p>
	    <p>Selected Sites gives an estimate of the fraction of individual nucleotide sites within a CRM that are under selection, i.e., evolving at a rate significantly different than that expected under a neutral substitution model. This fraction was calculated based on the method adapted from <a href="http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/68/245.extract" target="blank_">Chiaromonte et al., 2003.</a> Briefly, the empirical cumulative distribution functions were computed for PhyloP scores within CRMs and ancestral repeat sequences, which are presumed to be neutrally evolving. For each CRM, the fraction of sites under selection, &pi;&#770;, was computed according to equation 1:</p>
	    <p><img src="[% c.uri_for('/static/images/selsites.png') %]" name="Selected sites formula"/></p>
	    <p>Where F<sub>sel</sub>(x) and F<sub>neut</sub>(x) are the Gaussian kernel density estimates for selection in CRMs and ancestral repeats, respectively, and &epsilon; is a constant error term. Elements were separated by chromosome and divided into three equally-sized GC-content bins to reduce biases arising from regional variations in substitution rates and base composition.</p>
	    </li>
        </ol></li>
	<li>Gene Expression
	    <p class="indented">Gene expression data are based on RNA-seq datasets from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="blank_">ENCODE DCC Portal</a> for human K562 and GM12878, and mouse MEL and CH12 cells. Data were obtained as fastq sequencing reads and bam alignments and expression levels were estimated using two methods. First, <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/" target="blank_">kallisto</a> and <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/" target="blank_">sleuth</a> were used to map and quantify RNA-seq reads directly from the fastq reads. We prepared an alternative version of these data to which we applied a simple quantile normalization to mitigate the impact of sequencing batch effects. Second, we used an alternative method incorporating explicit normalization for batch effects,0 based on methods used <a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/4-121/v1" target="blank_">here.</a> All expression values are expressed as transcripts per million (TPM).</p>
	</li>
	<li>Gene Ontology
	    <p class="indented">Gene Ontology terms provide a uniform framework for classifying genes according to three functional aspects: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. Molecular function describes the molecular activities. Cellular component describes where in cells the gene product is active. Biological process describes pathways and broad processes in which a gene is active. More information is available <a href="http://geneontology.org/page/ontology-documentation" target="blank_">here.</a></p>
	    <p class="indented">In our dataset, CRMs within each grammatical pattern have been assigned to target genes based on the nearest TSS, and these sets of genes were used to mine the GO database for enriched terms using the <a href="http://chip-enrich.med.umich.edu/" target="blank_">ChipEnrich</a> R package. The resulting lists were further collapsed using the <a href="http://revigo.irb.hr/" target="blank_">REVIGO</a> tool and results are presented as dot plots and in tabular form.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Histone Modifications
	    <p class="indented">Histone modifications are used by cells to specify different functional states in chromatin, and can be a valuable predictive tool in ascribing potential functions to stretches of DNA. Histone modification ChIP-seq data were obtained from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="blank_">ENCODE DCC Portal</a> for human K562 and GM12878, and mouse MEL and CH12 cells. CRMs were annotated with the maximum position-wise score observed within each element for seven histone modifications.</p>

	    <p class="indented"><span class="italic">H3K27ac</span><br>This histone mark is most often associated with strong/active enhancers, differentiating them from weak/poised enhancers, which contain H3K4me1 alone <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/50/21931.full" target="_blank">(Creyghton et al., 2010)</a>.</p>
        </li>
	<li>ChromHMM
	    <p class="indented"><a href="http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/" target="blank_">ChromHMM</a> integrates signals from multiple histone modifications in order to predict the functional state of stretches of chromatin. These are expressed as color codes along the length of a DNA fragment, describing the combinations of histone modifications characteristic of different regulatory and coding functions, and polycomb repressed (hetero)chromatin. The ChromHMM data used in our analysis were obtained from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="blank_">ENCODE DCC Portal</a>, and incorporate four histone modifications: H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3K27me3. These combine into seven distinct chromatin states:</p>
	    <p class="indented"><table class="in_text">
		<tr><td style="background: rgb(255,0,0);">H3K4me3</td><td>Promoter elements</td></tr>
	    	<tr><td style="background: rgb(255,153,0);">H3K4me3 + H3K4me1</td><td>Strong enhancer elements</td></tr>
		<tr><td style="background: rgb(255,255,0);">H3K4me1</td><td>Weak enhancer elements</td></tr>

	    </table></p>
	    <p class="indented">Each CRM was annotated with the chromatin state predictions along its length and these are graphically represented as color codes spanning the length of the fragment in the results tables.</p>
        </li>
	<li>DNaseI Hypersensitivity
	    <p class="indented">DNaseI Hypersensitivity is used to demarcate regions of open chromtin, characteristic of functional regulatory and coding sequences. DNaseI hypersensitive elements used in this analysis were produced using DNase-Seq and assembled into contiguous elements using the Hotspot tool, and were obtained from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="blank_">ENCODE DCC Portal.</a></p>
        </li>
	<li>Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
    	    <p class="indented">Genome-Wide Association Studies are used to identify  single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with phenotypes of interest in a given genome. The NHGRI/EBI GWAS Catalog "is a quality controlled, manually curated, literature-derived collection of all published genome-wide association studies assaying at least 100,000 SNPs and all SNP-trait associations with p-values < 1.0 x 10-5." <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19474294" target="blank_">(Hindorff et al., 2009)</a> GWAS lead SNPs are associated with a trait, but are not necessarily directly responsible for variation in phenotype, and any SNP within linkage disequlibrium may represent the actual causal SNP. To account for this possibility, we incorporated all SNPs in linkage-disequilibrium with these SNPs at R<sup>2</sup> > 0.8 in our dataset before intersecting with human CRMs. These SNPs can be functionally classified according to an <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/ontology" target="blank_">ontology.</a> We have used these GWAS Ontology classifications, along with multiple primary literature and online sources, to functionally categorize GWAS SNPs in our dataset, which may help describe the functional significance of their host CRMs.</p>
