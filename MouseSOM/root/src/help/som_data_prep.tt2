<p class="centeredbold">SOM Data Preparation</p>
<p class="content_main">27 ChIP-seq datasets, for which there were data in both human K562 and GM12878 as well as data for their 1-to-1 orthologs in mouse MEL and CH12 cell types, were used to prepare the self-organizing map (SOM) dataset. All datasets are available from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="blank_">ENCODE project</a>. ChIP-seq experiments follow ENCODE standards for preprocessing, quality control and uniform peak calling. All data were downloaded from the ENCODE DCC portal. Human data map to hg19 and mouse data to mm9. All regions in each species were merged using <a href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="blank_">BedTools</a> mergeBed to create a base set of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in each species. These regions were then labeled with TF binding data specific to each cell type. Only regions with at least two TFs bound were considered for further analysis.</p>
<p class="content_main">The SOM was constructed using <a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867413012178" target="blank_">methods defined by us previously</a>. Briefly, we train a 38x28 toroidal SOM with hexagonal neurons with an update radius of â…“ map size and alpha of 0.05 for 100 epochs. We repeat this for 1000 trials to minimize the quantization error. We perform this analysis with a modified form of the kohonen R package available through <a href="https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/kohonen2" target="blank_">our github site</a>. In contrast to our previous methods, we also performed 10,000 random permutations of the SOM using the same set of parameters. We permuted labels of TFs on each region but kept cell type and organism constant for those labels. This allowed for us to correct for patterns that occur at low frequency by chance and for factors with many apparent associations due to their high frequency in the datasets. Using this empirical distribution we considered a neuron significant if it had an empirical p-value <= 0.0001 (i.e. has not appeared in any random permutations). In order to avoid thresholding issues, we then only considered differential regions to be those with an empirical p-value > 0.95 in non-enriched cell types.</p>
